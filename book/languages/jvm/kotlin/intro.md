# Inception

**Kotlin** is a cross-platform, general-purpose, statically typed programming language with type inference.

Kotlin is designed to fully interoperate with Java. The JVM version of its standard library is dependent on the Java Class Library.
It mainly targets JVM, but it can be also compiled to JavaScript, or, via LLVM, to native code.
Type interference allows its syntax to be more concise.

> File extensions for Clojure code are .kt .kts and .ktm
